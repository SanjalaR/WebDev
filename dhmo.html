<h1>Dihydrogen Monoxide</h1>
<pre>
<strong>Dihydrogen monoxide</strong>, also known as <em>hydroxyl acid</em> or <em>DHMO</em><sup>1</sup>, is a dangerous substance that<sup>2</sup>:
is the major component of acid rain,
contributes to the greenhouse effect,
may cause severe burns,
is fatal if inhaled,
contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape,
accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals,
may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness
of automobile brakes, and
has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.

Despite the danger, DHMO is often used:
as an industrial solvent and coolant,
in nuclear power plants
in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>,
as a fire retardant,
in many forms of cruel animal research,
as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products,
in the distribution of pesticides.

Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.
